# Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein
Levenshtein and Damerau-Levenshtein server implemented in C++ without any third party library.



## Compile and Run instructions Linux and macOS systems

* We have makefile file, go to the dictionary of the file.
* Compile with a C++11 compliant compiler:
```sh
make
```

### Run
Program can be run via command prompt
```sh
./Damerau-Levenshtein
```
or

```sh
./Levenshtein
```

Then you can give two strings as a standart input from terminal (stdin stream).

## Run without exacutables 
If you have a problem with compiling the files, I have uploaded exacutable files to moodle. If you directly want run them *Do not forget to give access*.

chmod +x Levenshtein
chmod +x Damerau-Levenshtein

Or just run:

chmod +x /path/to/your/file

chmod does also have some more advanced options, you can look from terminal via 'man chmod'
